        <h2>Barry Bonds</h2>
        <img src="images/bonds.png">
        <p>
            Barry Bonds, arguably the greatest baseball player of all time, uniquely combined immense power and precision at the plate with remarkable athleticism in the outfield. He held the MLB record for career home runs with 762 and for home runs in a single season with 73, which underscored his unparalleled slugging capabilities. However, Bonds was far more than just a power hitter. He was a complete player with a .298 career batting average, over 500 stolen bases, and he won eight Gold Glove awards for his defensive excellence. His seven MVP awards, more than any other player in history, epitomized his overall impact on the game. Bonds' unique ability to combine prodigious power, superb plate discipline, speed on the bases, and impressive defensive skills, makes a compelling case for him as the greatest baseball player of all time.

        <h2>Babe Ruth</h2>

        <p>
            Babe Ruth, also known as "The Bambino" and "The Sultan of Swat," is widely considered the greatest baseball player of all time, and for good reason. Ruth fundamentally changed the game of baseball with his unprecedented power, hitting 714 home runs in his career at a time when the long ball was not a dominant part of the game. He held the record for most home runs in a season and a career for several decades. Beyond his power hitting, Ruth was also an extraordinary pitcher, winning 94 games with a career ERA of 2.28, demonstrating a level of versatility unseen in today's specialization-driven game. His charisma and larger-than-life personality transcended the sport, making him one of the first true American sports celebrities. Ruth's transformative impact on baseball, his extraordinary talent, and his enduring legacy firmly cement his place as arguably the greatest player in baseball history.

        <h2>Ted Williams</h2>

        <p>
            Ted Williams, often referred to as "The Splendid Splinter," is arguably the greatest hitter in the history of baseball and thereby warrants consideration as its greatest player. He is the last player to have hit .400 in a season, a feat he achieved in 1941 with a remarkable .406 batting average, a testament to his unrivaled mastery at the plate. Over his 19-year career, all with the Boston Red Sox, Williams compiled a .344 lifetime batting average and slugged 521 home runs, even as his career was interrupted by service in both World War II and the Korean War. Williams' uncanny eye for the ball resulted in him leading the American League in walks eight times, contributing to an outstanding career on-base percentage of .482, the highest of all time. Beyond his statistical accomplishments, Williams' relentless pursuit of perfection in hitting, his leadership, and his dedication to his country reinforce his standing as a contender for the title of the greatest baseball player of all time.
